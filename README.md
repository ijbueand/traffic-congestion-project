# Traffic Congestion Project
Traffic congestion is a situation where the demand for road space exceeds the available supply which can have a number of negative consequences, including increased fuel consumption and air pollution, decreased productivity, and increased stress and frustration for drivers. The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model able to predict the amount of congestion given certain variables.
